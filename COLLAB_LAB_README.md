## Technical Implementation

### Backend

The backend is implemented using FastAPI with WebSockets for real-time communication:

- **WebSocket Protocol**: Enables bidirectional, real-time communication

- **Message Handling**: Routes different message types (lyrics updates, genre changes, etc.)
- **State Synchronization**: Ensures all clients have the same view of the project

### Frontend

The frontend is built with React and TailwindCSS:

- **React Components**: Modular components for different parts of the collaboration UI
- **WebSocket Hook**: Custom hook for managing WebSocket connections
- **Real-time Updates**: State management that responds to incoming messages
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices
