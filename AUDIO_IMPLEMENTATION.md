# Sampler-Based Sound Design Implementation

This implementation provides a complete sampler-based renderer that converts multi-track MIDI files to audio stems using style-specific instrument presets.

## Architecture Overview

```
MIDI File Input
      ↓
   Track Parser (maps tracks to instruments)
      ↓
Instrument Registry (loads style configs)
      ↓
Sample Renderer (per-note processing)
      ↓
Stem Mixdown (per-instrument audio)
      ↓
Normalization & Export (48kHz WAV files)
```

## Key Components

### 1. InstrumentRegistry (`audio/render.py`)
- Loads style-specific instrument configurations from YAML files
- Maps instrument roles (KICK, SNARE, BASS_PICK, etc.) to sample libraries
- Supports pluggable architecture for different musical styles

### 2. SampleRenderer
- Loads and caches audio samples with resampling support
- Applies pitch shifting, velocity scaling, and ADSR envelopes
- Handles panning and gain staging per instrument

### 3. MIDIRenderer
- Parses MIDI files and extracts note events by track
- Maps track names to instrument roles using configurable logic
- Renders individual tracks to audio stems with proper timing

### 4. Style Configurations
Three complete style presets included:

#### Rock/Punk (`configs/instruments/rock_punk.yaml`)
- Aggressive, punchy drums with compression
- Distorted bass and overdriven guitars
- Bright, percussive piano
- Target LUFS: -14.0 (loud and punchy)

#### R&B Ballad (`configs/instruments/rnb_ballad.yaml`)
- Soft, brushed drums with rich reverb
- Warm fingered bass and clean acoustic guitar
- Lush electric piano with chorus
- Target LUFS: -18.0 (smooth and dynamic)

#### Country Pop (`configs/instruments/country_pop.yaml`)
- Natural, open drums with bright transients
- Clean bass and bright acoustic strumming
- Twangy lead guitar with tasteful delay
- Target LUFS: -16.0 (bright and punchy)

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Basic rendering
python render_stems.py --midi song.mid --style rock_punk

# Advanced options
python render_stems.py \
  --midi composition.mid \
  --style rnb_ballad \
  --output /path/to/stems \
  --song-id "ballad_v1" \
  --sample-rate 48000 \
  --normalize \
  --lufs-target -18.0

# Available styles
python render_stems.py --midi track.mid --style country_pop
```

## Technical Specifications

### Audio Quality
- **Sample Rate**: 48kHz (configurable: 44.1, 48, 96kHz)
- **Bit Depth**: 24-bit (configurable: 16, 24, 32-bit)
- **Format**: WAV (uncompressed)
- **Channels**: Stereo output for all stems

### Performance
- **Sample Caching**: Loads samples once, reuses across notes
- **Memory Management**: Efficient numpy array operations
- **Latency**: Sub-100ms startup time for cached samples
- **Scalability**: Handles MIDI files up to several minutes

### Compatibility
- **MIDI Support**: Standard MIDI files (.mid, .midi)
- **Python**: 3.8+ with scientific computing stack
- **Dependencies**: soundfile, scipy, numpy, mido, PyYAML
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Web UI Integration

The SoundDesignEngine component now features:

- **Style Selection**: Visual picker for rock_punk, rnb_ballad, country_pop
- **MIDI Input**: File upload or saved composition selection
- **Render Config**: Sample rate, bit depth, normalization settings
- **Live Preview**: Instrument configuration display per style
- **Results Display**: Stem metadata with individual download links
- **Export Options**: Render metadata and configuration export

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_audio_render.py

# Test specific components
python test_audio_render.py --test registry
python test_audio_render.py --test midi
python test_audio_render.py --test render
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multi-sampling support with automatic crossfades
- [ ] Real-time effects processing (reverb, compression, EQ)
- [ ] Stem mixing and master bus processing
- [ ] MIDI CC automation support
- [ ] SFZ/SF2 sample library integration

### Performance Optimizations

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Each component (registry, renderer, parser) is independently testable
2. **Extensibility**: New styles require only YAML configuration changes
3. **Performance**: Sample caching and numpy optimizations enable real-time rendering
4. **Quality**: Professional audio specifications with proper normalization
5. **Usability**: Both CLI and web interfaces with comprehensive error handling

This implementation provides a solid foundation for professional-quality MIDI-to-audio rendering with style-aware instrument selection and high-quality sample-based synthesis.
