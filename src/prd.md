- How to ensure style tokens provide sufficient guidance for all module types
- How to handle version compatibility as individual modules are updated

## Reflection

This modular approach uniquely addresses the complexity of AI music production by treating it as a professional pipeline system rather than a collection of separate tools. The loose coupling architecture allows for continuous improvement of individual modules while maintaining system stability.

The assumption that users want both module independence and integrated workflows should be validated through user testing. The solution becomes truly exceptional through its combination of professional-grade individual modules with seamless pipeline integration and comprehensive style control throughout the entire production process.
