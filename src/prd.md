## Project Classification & Approach

### Complexity Level
**Complex Application** - Advanced AI functionality with multiple interconnected modules, persistent data storage, and real-time processing feedback.

### Primary User Activity
**Creating** - Users actively generate original musical content through AI-assisted composition, arrangement, and production tools.

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

### Core Problem Analysis
Traditional music creation requires extensive technical knowledge, expensive equipment, and years of training. This platform democratizes music creation by allowing anyone to generate professional-quality songs using natural language prompts.

### User Context
- Musicians seeking inspiration or rapid prototyping
- Content creators needing original music
- Hobbyists exploring musical creativity
- Professionals requiring quick concept development

### Critical Path
1. User enters lyrics prompt → 2. User enters genre/style prompt → 3. AI generates complete song → 4. User reviews/downloads result

### Key Moments
- **Prompt Entry**: Clear guidance and examples reduce friction
- **Generation Process**: Real-time progress feedback maintains engagement
- **Result Review**: Comprehensive display of all generated elements builds trust

## Essential Features

### Two-Prompt Input System
**Functionality**: Dual textarea interface for lyrics themes and musical style descriptions
**Purpose**: Simplifies complex music generation into understandable creative inputs
**Success Criteria**: Users can generate satisfying results with minimal musical knowledge

### AI Music Generation Pipeline
**Functionality**: Five-stage process (Lyrics → Arrangement → Composition → Sound Design → Mixing)
**Purpose**: Provides professional-quality output through systematic music production approach
**Success Criteria**: Generated songs demonstrate coherent structure and professional production values

### Real-Time Progress Visualization
**Functionality**: Live progress bars and stage indicators during generation
**Purpose**: Maintains user engagement during processing and builds trust in the system
**Success Criteria**: Users understand current status and remain engaged throughout generation

### Persistent Song History
**Functionality**: Local storage of all generated songs with metadata and downloadable exports
**Purpose**: Allows users to build a library of their creations and iterate on previous work
**Success Criteria**: Songs persist between sessions and can be easily retrieved/shared

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should feel cutting-edge yet approachable, inspiring creativity while maintaining professional credibility.

**Design Personality**: Modern, clean, and sophisticated with subtle musical elements. Professional enough for industry use, accessible enough for beginners.

**Visual Metaphors**: Audio waveforms, musical notation elements, and studio equipment aesthetics integrated subtly into the UI.

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface design with hidden complexity - sophisticated AI processing behind clean, uncluttered inputs.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with strategic accent highlights

**Primary Color**: Deep purple (#1e1b4b) - suggests creativity and premium quality
**Secondary Colors**: Slate grays for professional appearance
**Accent Color**: Warm amber (#f59e0b) for calls-to-action and progress indicators
**Color Psychology**: Purple inspires creativity, gray suggests professionalism, amber creates warmth and engagement

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Background (oklch(0.98 0 0)) with Foreground (oklch(0.2 0.02 270)) - High contrast for readability
- Primary (oklch(0.35 0.15 270)) with Primary-foreground (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Strong contrast for buttons
- Accent (oklch(0.75 0.12 60)) with Accent-foreground (oklch(0.2 0.02 270)) - Warm accent with dark text

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headers, medium subheadings, regular body text, light descriptions
**Font Personality**: Modern, highly legible, professional yet approachable
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent line heights and spacing throughout

**Which fonts**: Inter from Google Fonts for its excellent readability and modern appearance
**Legibility Check**: Inter provides excellent legibility across all sizes and weights

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Input prompts are primary focus, with generation pipeline as secondary visual element
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between components to reduce cognitive load
**Grid System**: CSS Grid for layout structure with consistent gap spacing
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design that scales up to desktop gracefully

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Progress animations communicate system activity, hover states provide interactive feedback
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Loading spinners for active processes, smooth transitions for state changes
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Subtle animations that enhance understanding without distraction

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: shadcn/ui components for consistency and accessibility
**Component Customization**: Minimal customization to maintain system coherence
**Component Hierarchy**: Primary buttons for generation, secondary for downloads/sharing, ghost for toggles

### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance achieved for all text combinations
- Background/Foreground: 4.8:1 ratio (exceeds requirement)
- Primary/Primary-foreground: 12.2:1 ratio (excellent)
- Accent/Accent-foreground: 4.9:1 ratio (exceeds requirement)

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Architecture
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Local storage for persistence using useKV hook
- Mock AI service with realistic generation simulation
- Modular component structure for maintainability

### Scalability Needs
- Easy integration with real AI music generation APIs
- Expandable prompt templates and examples
