- **Visual Metaphors**: Recording studio aesthetics, waveforms, musical notation elements
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface with professional controls, but with clear hierarchy and guided workflow

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with accent highlights
- **Primary Color**: Deep purple (oklch(0.35 0.15 270)) - represents creativity and professionalism
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays and whites for content areas
- **Accent Color**: Warm gold (oklch(0.75 0.12 60)) - draws attention to key actions and highlights
- **Color Psychology**: Purple conveys creativity and sophistication, gold represents achievement and quality
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards for contrast
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (oklch(0.98 0 0)) + Foreground (oklch(0.2 0.02 270)) = High contrast for readability
  - Primary (oklch(0.35 0.15 270)) + Primary-foreground (oklch(0.98 0 0)) = Strong contrast for buttons
  - Accent (oklch(0.75 0.12 60)) + Accent-foreground (oklch(0.2 0.02 270)) = Clear visibility for highlights

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single high-quality sans-serif family (Inter) for consistency and professionalism
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, body text, labels, and metadata
- **Font Personality**: Clean, modern, highly legible - appropriate for technical/creative work
- **Readability Focus**: Optimal line height (1.5), appropriate sizing, generous spacing
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent weights and sizes across similar elements
- **Which fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts) - excellent readability and professional appearance
- **Legibility Check**: Inter is specifically designed for screen legibility and UI applications

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Tab-based navigation guides users through composition workflow
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing creates breathing room and reduces cognitive load
- **Grid System**: Card-based layout with consistent spacing and alignment
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design that scales up to desktop
- **Content Density**: Balanced information density - detailed when needed, clean when possible

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions reinforce the professional, polished feel
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Priority on functional feedback (loading states, interactions)
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal, purposeful animations that enhance rather than distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: 
  - Cards for feature sections and content organization
  - Tabs for main navigation between composition tools
  - Forms with proper labeling for input controls
  - Progress indicators for AI processing
  - Badges for metadata and status information
- **Component Customization**: Custom color scheme applied through CSS variables
- **Component States**: Clear hover, active, and disabled states for all interactive elements
